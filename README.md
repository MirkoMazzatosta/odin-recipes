ToP Recipes Project!
Well, first real project of Foundation Course by The Odin Project.
Not so much, i just made a single landing page with the logo and some links to the
recipe pages.
I made 3 recipe pages (Pizza, Fries and Tonkatsu) with the corresponding images,
the ingredients (put them into an unordered list) and the steps (put them into an ordered list) 
needed to cook them.
In the end i routed them to the the landing page and pushed everything to GitHub repo!
